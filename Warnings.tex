\section{\texttt{Hazards and Warnings}}

Your LulzBot\textsuperscript{\miniscule{\textregistered}} Mini 3D printer has motorized and heated parts.  Always be aware of possible hazards when the printer is operational.

\index{burns}
Never touch the hot end nozzle or heater block without first turning off the hot end and allowing it to completely cool down. The hot end can take up to 20 minutes to completely cool. Never touch recently extruded plastic. The plastic can stick to your skin and cause burns. The print surface can reach high temperatures that are capable of causing burns.

\subsection{\textcolor{red}{Fire Hazard}}
Never place flammable materials or liquids on or near the printer when it is powered on or operational. Liquid acetone, alcohol, or other chemicals may release vapors that are extremely flammable.

\subsection{\textcolor{red}{Pinch Hazard}}

When the printer is operational take care to never put your fingers near any moving parts including belts, pulleys, or gears. Tie back long hair or clothing that can get caught in the moving parts of the printer.
